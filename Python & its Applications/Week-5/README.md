# Welcome to Week-5 of Learner's Space
We have almost reached the end of the course. This is the last week. By now you would have got an overview of Python and seen 3 interesting applications of it
while learning about many different libraries. One important skill you should have developed by now is the ability to learn about new libraries using the 
documentation or any other resource. 

This week you can choose whatever topics you find interesting from those given below. Many of them are extensions of what you have learnt earlier.

- [Scipy for Scientific Computing](#Scipy-for-Scientific-Computing)
- [Web Scraping with Selenium](#Web-Scraping-with-Selenium)
- [GUI Development using TKinter](#GUI-Development-using-TKinter)
- [Using APIs in Python](#APIs-in-Python)

Then you can make any of the mini projects that involves whatever you have learnt this week.

## Scipy for Scientific Computing

SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.

The additional benefit of basing SciPy on Python is that this also makes a powerful programming language available for use in developing sophisticated programs and specialized applications. Scientific applications using SciPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of the software landscape by developers across the world. Everything from parallel programming to web and data-base subroutines and classes have been made available to the Python programmer. All of this power is available in addition to the mathematical libraries in SciPy.

You can head on to this [link](https://www.edureka.co/blog/scipy-tutorial/) for an introduction to SciPy. Another reference for a more comprehensive overview is provided [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/scipy_quick_guide.htm). It includes the implementations of the varied subpackages. Ofcourse to know about any method of the library you can look into its [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/).

## Web Scraping with Selenium

Selenium is a framework which allows us to interact with the HTML elements of a website. So till now, we were only extracting data from a HTML webpage and then using it for different tasks. In addition to extracting data, Selenium allows us to interact with the webpage as well. So any interaction that you perform with a webpage can be automated using Selenium, for eg: Filling a form online, reading and extracting elements of the source code, etc. Now we will only be covering the basic of Selenium here, since Selenium in itself requires another course for learning.

You can checkout this YouTube playlist on Introduction to Selenium - [Selenium Tutorials Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n40rB1XaJ0ak1bemvlqumQ).

Optionally, you can also checkout this link for reading tutorials - [Selenium WebDriver Tutorials](https://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html). This link also covers advanced tutorials on selenium webdrivers, so if you want to explore more of Selenium, you can go through them.
The [documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/getting_started/) for this library is also easy to understand and you can try going through it to know more.

## GUI Development using TKinter
Tkinter is one of the most commonly used method for GUI development. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface.

Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −

1. Import the Tkinter module.

2. Create the GUI application main window.

3. Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.

4. Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

You can head over to this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tkinter-tutorial/) to learn more about tkinter. You can also refer [this](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tkinter) for a comprehensive overview of all UI widgets.

For those prefering video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMP1oQOxfM0) is a good source to refer to.

You can refer to the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) as well to learn anymore about this library.

## APIs in Python
An API or Application Programming Interface is something through which a website distributes the data avaliable on the web server. We can use these APIs to extract whatever data we want from websites. Retrieving data using APIs can be useful when the data on the web server is dynamic, that is, changing constantly, for example, stock price data. Knowing how to consume an API is one of those magical skills that, once mastered, will crack open a whole new world of possibilities, and consuming APIs using Python is a great way to learn such a skill.

A good analogy for understanding APIs is that when you type in a URL, you request a webpage from the webserver, similarly, through an API you request data from the webserver. This data is returned in JSON format. You did this last week when you extracted data from website using requests and then further used it with Beautiful Soup. Here we will go into more details about the topic.  

You can go to this [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/) for a basic tutorial on APIs.  

You can also head over to [this link](https://realpython.com/python-api/) for a more advanced tutorial.

As you saw APIs can grants access to specific data and methods that other applications can access – and sometimes edit – via standard HTTP protocols, just like a website. **REpresentational State Transfer (REST)**, is one of the most popular architectural style of APIs for web services. It consists of a set of guidelines designed to simplify client / server communication. REST APIs make data access much more straightforward and logical.

You can visit [this link](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/) to learn more about using REST APIs. This even covers how to buid your own APIs which if you want you can skip.

That may have seemed like a ton!

There's a lot more you could do in Python beyond this as well, and you can choose to apply any/all of these for a Project.

## Project

You could use all the tools you learnt about in the above sections and/or learn even more, extend/combine what you've learnt in previous weeks to build a Project.

For example. You could integrate TF-IDF/BM25 with PageRank and Web Crawling to build a full-fledged search engine, You could build complex games like Hangman, You could build a Web UI, which scrapes any website for real-time stock prices and build an Automated Stock Trader using that!

You can do whatever you want, if you are short on ideas, ways to start, we've compiled a small list for you: (Apart from the ones mentioned above!)

* File Explorer (using Tkinter and File Handling)
* Plagiarism Checker (using Applications learnt in Week 4)
* Music Player (using PyGame)
* Instagram Photo Downloader (using Web Scraping and other Web-Dev tools)
* Another variant of SAFE (using Tkinter and if you want to explore some Cryptography)
* Content Aggregator (Eg. A Script which could download all lectures-slides of a particular course from Moodle/NPTEL. Involves Web Scraping)
* A virtual version of your favourite Board Game (using PyGame, Tkinter)
