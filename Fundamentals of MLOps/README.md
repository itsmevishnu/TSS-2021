### <div align="center">[TSS - 2021]</div>

Ever wondered how organizations build, deploy, maintain, adapt, retrain & redeploy large-scale AI-powered applications?   
In today's fast-paced industry, maintaining & deploying scalable applications while being able to adapt quickly to the changing consumer requirements is of utmost importance. 

## ***WnCC & Career Cell bring to you a course on Fundamentals of MLOps!***  
Through this course, you will be introduced to some of the core ideas behind combining the long-established practices of DevOps with the emerging field of Machine Learning. You will be exposed to the various stages of the ML model lifecycle, including data versioning, experimentation, evaluation & monitoring. To consolidate these principles, you will also get an opportunity to build & deploy end-to-end ML pipelines by leveraging various ML Operations Management tools.

**Pre-Requisites:** Reasonable understanding of Python, Traditional ML Algorithms & Performance Metrics  
**Course Duration:**  4 weeks  
**Time Commitment:** 8-10 hrs per week (1-2 hrs more for optional material)
